Fix: the deploy-sandbox file filter now keeps the `package.json` of EVERY excluded directory, not just `apps/*` ones. A blanket exclusion of a directory that is also a workspace member (e.g. `infrastructure/`) starved the sandboxed `bun install` of that member's manifest and failed the whole build with `Workspace not found`. A kept manifest for a non-member directory is inert, so the rule is now uniform.
